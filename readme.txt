SOUNDBOKS theme for the case by Josephine

Step 1 is mostly done (some small details are not perfect), step 2 partially (svg images for the small icons, missing the replacement by @2x images)

The theme will display the cart page when applied to a blank page in Wordpress. 
It is based on the 3 templates "header", "page", and "footer", which are built to look like the design.
Just download it and apply it to your wordpress.

Everything is static.
Basically just HTML and CSS.

The font has been found on the Internet, and has not a perfect display. 
The symbol "|" is not appering correctly for example.
